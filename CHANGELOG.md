## Unreleased

### Breaking
- Label rules are now keyed on the strict triple (payer, payee, counterparty IBAN) instead of (IBAN, name key). The `label_rules` table is rebuilt on startup, which **discards all previously learned rules**. Rules regenerate automatically as labels are re-assigned; there is no other visible signal of the loss.
